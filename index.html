                        the cartilage from the nose. In this surgery, the overall size of the nose is reduced and,

                        grafting, the surgeon uses the cartilage behind the ear or the client's rib to enlarge the nose.
                        In addition to nose reconstruction, patients sometimes undergo skin grafting in order to achieve

                        the tip may or may not be in midline (S-shaped crooked nose deformity).
                        Crooked Nose structural problems often contribute to nose functional problems like nasal
                        obstruction and also complicate optimal surgical management.

                        conditions. The depressed nasal dorsum may involve bony, cartilaginous or both bony and

                        It is corrected with augmentation rhinoplasty by filling the dorsum of nose with cartilage, bone
                        or synthetic implant.

                        Tip rhinoplasty is a surgical procedure of the tip of the nose to improve nasal function by

                        Typically, tip rhinoplasty involves modification of cartilage of the tip of the nose, including
                        excision (removal), dissection (cutting), repositioning, or augmentation to create the desired
                        outcome.

                        Septoplasty is the treatment of crooked nasal septum. Some people suffer from nasal congestion
                        due to having a deviated septum. A crooked septum can be caused by an injury or blow to the
                        nose, or it can be congenital. The nasal septum moves to one side and can significantly block
                        the flow of air through the nose. This process is an outpatient surgery and the surgeon removes
                        the extra parts of bone and cartilage and moves the deviated septum to the proper position.

                    Rhinoplasty is recognized as one of the most complex cosmetic procedures. You can maximize the
                    safety of your surgery by selecting a qualified board certified facial plastic surgeon who regularly
                    performs nose procedures. Extensive experience performing rhinoplasty can increase the likelihood of
                    achieving your desired outcome while minimizing the need for a secondary procedure. Dr. Shadfar will

                    Dr. Anil performs nose surgery on a diverse range of individuals and achieves beautiful rhinoplasty
                    results by using intricate techniques to enhance and complement a patient’s natural facial features.
                    As such, attaining an optimal outcome often involves unique consideration of the various
                    characteristics that make up a patient’s natural beauty. Men and women of Asian, Caucasian,
                    African-American, Latino, and Middle-Eastern descent typically have distinctive facial features that
                    differentiate one ethnicity from the other, creating the need to preserve the character of a
                    patient’s facial appearance within the context of their aesthetic goals. In using rhinoplasty to
                    create a more harmonious balance between facial features, Dr. Anil customizes each treatment plan to
                    attain natural-looking results for all patients, and will work with you to achieve your ideal

                <div class="pg9">
                    For patients who desire a non-surgical method of resculpting their nasal features, liquid
                    rhinoplasty can be a minimally invasive technique to enhance the appearance of the nose without
                    extensive downtime. This treatment utilizes dermal fillers to alter the size or shape of certain
                    aspects of the nose, straighten or disguise a nasal hump, and fill in depressions causing an
                    asymmetrical appearance. While this technique cannot achieve results that are as extensive and
                    long-lasting as surgical rhinoplasty, liquid rhinoplasty offers a more conservative treatment to
                    cosmetically refine the proportions of the nose. If you are interested in non-surgical nose
                    contouring, Dr. Anil can examine your features in a consultation and help you determine whether you
                    can benefit from liquid rhinoplasty.

            <b>After rhinoplasty,</b>
            you may have a few side effects and complications for a short while, and you’ll probably feel ‘bunged up for
            a week or two after your operation and have to breathe through your mouth.
            <br>
            You may have soreness, swelling, and bruising, particularly around your eyes, and you might get headaches.
            In addition, your face will feel puffy, so your doctor might prescribe a painkiller and nose spray.
            <br><br>
            Your doctor may ask you to follow some precautions after the surgery, such as:<br>
            →Avoid strenuous exercise or contact sports.<br>
            →Follow a particular type of diets like eating fruits and vegetables.<br>
            →Stay away from extreme facial expressions (smiling or laughing).
            <br>
            →Brush your teeth gently and other several instructions.
            <br>
            Everyone recovers from rhinoplasty differently; some people may return to their lives sooner than others.
            Depending on your case, the surgeon will decide when you can return to your activity. If you must fly, it is
            best to wait for a week or two, and you should wait a few days before you drive.

                        Usually, the nose continues to grow until the age of puberty (around 16 years old) and after
                        that this growth stops, so it is not a wise thing to do surgery before this age, but this
                        operation can also be done in old age. It is very successful if the patient does not have heart
                        or other underlying problems.
