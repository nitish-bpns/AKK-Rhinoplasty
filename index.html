                        grafting, the surgeon uses the cartilage behind the ear or the client's rib to enlarge the nose.
                        In addition to nose reconstruction, patients sometimes undergo skin grafting in order to achieve

                        Crooked Nose structural problems often contribute to nose functional problems like nasal
                        obstruction and also complicate optimal surgical management.

                        conditions. The depressed nasal dorsum may involve bony, cartilaginous or both bony and

                        Tip rhinoplasty is a surgical procedure of the tip of the nose to improve nasal function by

                        Typically, tip rhinoplasty involves modification of cartilage of the tip of the nose, including
                        excision (removal), dissection (cutting), repositioning, or augmentation to create the desired
                        outcome.

                        Septoplasty is the treatment of crooked nasal septum. Some people suffer from nasal congestion
                        due to having a deviated septum. A crooked septum can be caused by an injury or blow to the
                        nose, or it can be congenital. The nasal septum moves to one side and can significantly block
                        the flow of air through the nose. This process is an outpatient surgery and the surgeon removes
                        the extra parts of bone and cartilage and moves the deviated septum to the proper position.

                    Rhinoplasty is recognized as one of the most complex cosmetic procedures. You can maximize the
                    safety of your surgery by selecting a qualified board certified facial plastic surgeon who regularly
                    performs nose procedures. Extensive experience performing rhinoplasty can increase the likelihood of
                    achieving your desired outcome while minimizing the need for a secondary procedure. Dr. Shadfar will

                    Dr. Anil performs nose surgery on a diverse range of individuals and achieves beautiful rhinoplasty
                    results by using intricate techniques to enhance and complement a patient’s natural facial features.
                    As such, attaining an optimal outcome often involves unique consideration of the various
                    characteristics that make up a patient’s natural beauty. Men and women of Asian, Caucasian,
                    African-American, Latino, and Middle-Eastern descent typically have distinctive facial features that
                    differentiate one ethnicity from the other, creating the need to preserve the character of a
                    patient’s facial appearance within the context of their aesthetic goals. In using rhinoplasty to
                    create a more harmonious balance between facial features, Dr. Anil customizes each treatment plan to
                    attain natural-looking results for all patients, and will work with you to achieve your ideal
                    cosmetic outcome.

                <div class="pg9">
                    For patients who desire a non-surgical method of resculpting their nasal features, liquid
                    rhinoplasty can be a minimally invasive technique to enhance the appearance of the nose without
                    extensive downtime. This treatment utilizes dermal fillers to alter the size or shape of certain
                    aspects of the nose, straighten or disguise a nasal hump, and fill in depressions causing an
                    asymmetrical appearance. While this technique cannot achieve results that are as extensive and
                    long-lasting as surgical rhinoplasty, liquid rhinoplasty offers a more conservative treatment to
                    cosmetically refine the proportions of the nose. If you are interested in non-surgical nose
                    contouring, Dr. Anil can examine your features in a consultation and help you determine whether you
                    can benefit from liquid rhinoplasty.
